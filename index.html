      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>The vast majority of my adult life has been spent working in the under belly of the restaurant world. Hot kitchens, long days on my feet, endless cuts and burns. While these things may not traslate to the tech world on the surface, the lessons I have learned along the way have set me up perfectly. Working as a team to accomplish tasks, building recepies, thriving under pressure, and keeping calm when it all goes sideways. I look forward to the new challanges ahead, providing instant value to the team, and becoming a leader once again in a strange new world! </p>
